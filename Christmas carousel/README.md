Task:
- Wire up the buttons to switch through the images in the imgs array. 
- Make sure that the gallery works no matter how many images are added.
- Decide/implement what to do when you reach either end of the array - do nothing and disable buttons, loop back round to the other end, or something else?
- Remember to also update the alt tags.

Stretch goals:
- Add transitions for a smooth effect.
- Allow the user to zoom in and out of the images.
